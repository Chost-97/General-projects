# [RESOW](https://github.com/Chost97/General-projects/blob/master/RESOW/resow_v1.c) Application-(Read, Sort and Write) 
This is written in C for creating a float values of numbers and storing on file and then reading from the saves file. The float numbers are sorted using different algorithms(merge and selection sort) and then write the sorted elements on the new file. Performance analysis is the main criteria behind creation of RESOW application. Initially the application is checked for scalability and updated for handling large number of float values. The RESOW underwent many  performance optimizaitons for optimising the space and time complexities.
